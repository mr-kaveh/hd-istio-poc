implements istio Service Mesh Layer for Kubernetes Deployment

A  **service mesh**  is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication within a microservices architecture. It provides several key functionalities:

1.  **Traffic Management**: Controls the flow of traffic between services, enabling features like load balancing, traffic splitting, and retries.
2.  **Security**: Enhances security through mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted communication between services, and provides fine-grained access control.
3.  **Observability**: Offers detailed insights into service interactions, including metrics, logging, and tracing, which help in monitoring and debugging.
4.  **Service Discovery**: Automatically detects and keeps track of services within the mesh, simplifying the management of service endpoints

By abstracting these concerns away from the application code, a service mesh allows developers to focus on business logic while ensuring reliable and secure communication between services.
